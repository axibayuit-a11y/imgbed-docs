# Blog

The blog feature adds a standalone blog page to your ImgBed site.

After it is enabled, visitors can open:

```text
https://your-domain.com/blog/
```

The blog is adapted from the open-source [LyraVoid/Mizuki](https://github.com/LyraVoid/Mizuki) project. ImgBed rewrites and integrates it with Vue so it can run as part of the image hosting site.

## Where To Configure It

Blog settings are under:

```text
System Settings -> Other Settings -> Blog
```

## First-Time Setup

1. Turn on `Enable`.
2. Select the GitHub account used to store blog configuration.
3. Click `Update Blog`.
4. Wait for the success message.
5. Open `https://your-domain.com/blog/` to view the blog.

On first use, ImgBed prepares a private GitHub repository under the selected account:

```text
imgbed-blog-config
```

This repository stores blog settings and article content.

## Writing Posts

Edit blog posts in your private GitHub repository:

```text
imgbed-blog-config
```

Typical workflow:

1. Open GitHub.
2. Enter the private `imgbed-blog-config` repository.
3. Edit or add post files.
4. Commit the changes.
5. Return to the ImgBed admin panel and click `Update Blog`, or click the logo in the upper-left corner of the blog homepage three times to trigger a blog update.

`Update Blog` does not overwrite content you have written. It initializes the repository when needed and refreshes blog cache.

## Supported Features

The blog supports common blog features such as post lists, categories, tags, archives, search, dark mode, and language switching.

It also supports comments and visit statistics.

Comments appear below posts. Visitors can submit an avatar, nickname, email, and comment content.

Visit statistics show post views and site visits, helping you understand blog traffic.

## URL

The blog is always served under `/blog/`.

For example, if your ImgBed domain is:

```text
https://image.example.com
```

The blog URL is:

```text
https://image.example.com/blog/
```

After the blog is disabled, visitors can no longer access the blog page.
